     <h2>Where have i worked?</h2>
<p>Well i used to work at compucom the experience accroding to them was "Your experience with Compucom will vary greatly depending on your role, location, and account you are working on if assigned to a specific customer. It is a competitive environment and there are some very smart people in senior roles setting a good direction overall. They need to be wary of taking cost cutting too far to the point where it negatively impacts services to long standing customers. More educational opportunities, encourage personal growth and promote from within. Reward key players for top performance" well i had the job for about 2 years then i quit and joined hola code.</p>
